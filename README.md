# Concert-Location-and-Alert
A desktop application for automatically keeping track of upcoming concerts near you. Set up once, and let it do its thing.

# Overview
The driving idea behind this is pretty simple, as an avid concert-goer I've found it painfully easy
to either forget about an upcoming concert, or even more often never find out about it at all. While there
are websites out there like BandsinTown or the like, I wanted something that would be more straightforward,
as well as not be dependent on checking a website, something that I could set up once, and then have automatically
inform me of nearby concerts for all the bands I like, even if I never touched the application again. And since that didn't
exist (as far as I know), I made one.

Part of the motivation for making this was to showcase what an intermediate-ish level python project might look like. To
that end I've tried to comment the code such that it should be clear at all points what's going on. If you have a suggestion
in order to improve what's there, feel free to let me know.


# Install

Download the application based on your OS and run it. Once you've gotten through the initial setup you're done!

# Known Issues

Not every upcoming concert will be picked up on first pass, setting up the automatic launch stuff gets around this mostly,
but it's something to keep in mind if you forgo those.
